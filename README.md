# GameJam_2016
First game ever made with couple of friends in Global Game Jam 2016 Kaunas. The topic was "ritual". 
It's a puzzle game about a Silly Worshipper who has a goal to reach the altar and pray for Satan or something along those lines.
We used Processing as it was the only tool we knew about at the time.
